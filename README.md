# DiceGame
The player has three rolls per turn. 
After the first roll, if the user clicks a dice, it will remain "held" and not roll the next time the user rolls the dice.
Its image should update accordingly. 
Once three rolls are up, determine what is the best "hand" the user has. 
Inform the user of what hand they have and how many points they received this round.
The "Roll" button should say "Play Again" once the player's turn is over. 
This should clear the Dice, allowing the user to start over.
Keep track of how many points overall the user has (i.e. keep a running total of how much they scored each turn)

Hands:

5 of a kind - 10 points
Straight (5 numbers in a row i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) - 8 points
Four of a Kind - 7 points
Full House (3 of one kind, 2 of another) - 6 points
3 of a kind - 5 points
2 pair (2 of one kind, 2 of another, and 1 other value) - 4 points
2 of a kind - 1 point
